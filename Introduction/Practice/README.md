# 🏋️ How to Practice

At this point, you’ve mastered the theory behind the **Algorithm Design Canvas** — great job! 🎉  
You’re already ahead of many other candidates.  

The next big question is:  
👉 How do you **apply what you’ve learned** and practice effectively for interviews?

Try solving these tasks **using the Canvas**.  
This way, you train yourself to follow the process every time.

## 🌐 Use Online Judges
Reading books or skimming solutions is helpful, but nothing beats **hands-on practice**.  

Online judges like **LeetCode** are essential tools:  
- They auto-grade your solutions with tough test cases.  
- They provide problem banks across all difficulty levels.  
- They support multiple programming languages.  
- They give access to communities and extra learning resources.  

Other great sites for practice:  
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)  
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)

## 📝 Always Follow the Canvas
It’s tempting to **skip steps** in the Canvas while practicing (for example, skipping Constraints or Tests).  
- Sometimes people do this to “save time”.  
- Sometimes they think the problem is too easy.  

⚠️ This is a mistake.  

The Canvas is designed to **prepare you for any interview situation**.  
By practicing every section, you’ll build habits that make you confident and adaptable under pressure.

## 🚫 Forget About Your IDE
As discussed earlier in the **Code** section, writing in your IDE is very different from coding in an interview.  
- IDEs give autocomplete, debugging, and linting.  
- Interviews often don’t.  

👉 That’s why you should **practice outside your IDE**:  
- Use the **Canvas code section**.  
- Or, use the **online editor** directly.  

This trains you to be comfortable coding in any environment.

## 🔍 Read Through Your Code
In real life, many developers write some code and spend most of their time debugging it.  
That’s fine at work, but it doesn’t work at interviews.  

In interviews, you must:  
- Write **carefully**.  
- **Review your code** after writing it.  
- Ensure it’s correct before saying it’s done.  

If using an online judge:  
- Don’t rush to hit **Compile & Run**.  
- Be 100% confident your code will pass before testing.  

This habit will save you during interviews where you can’t rely on a debugger.

## ✅ Summary
To practice effectively, remember to:  
1. Sign up for an online judge like **LeetCode**.  
2. Always follow the **Algorithm Design Canvas**, even for simple problems.  
3. Practice coding **without your IDE**.  
4. Review your code carefully before running tests.  

By building these habits, you’ll maximize the effectiveness of your prep and walk into interviews with confidence. 🚀
