# ⏱️ Complexity

For every **idea** you discuss in an interview, it’s critical to evaluate its **efficiency**.  
Efficiency is measured in terms of an algorithm’s **time complexity** and **space (memory) complexity**.

## 🔑 Why Complexity Matters
Solving problems is not only about producing the correct result.  
A solution must also:  
1. Run **fast enough** (time efficiency).  
2. Use a **reasonable amount of memory** (space efficiency).  

Even the smartest algorithm is not useful if it takes hours to run or consumes too much memory.  

During an interview, showing that you can:  
- Evaluate **time and memory complexity**  
- Compare different approaches  

…proves that you can **choose the right solution in real-world scenarios**.  

👉 Failing to do this often lowers your chances of passing a technical interview.

## 📚 Essential Readings
If you’re not fully confident with complexities, don’t worry — we have a separate section on **Computational Complexity** right after this one.  

It includes:  
- Lessons on time and space complexity basics  
- Guidance on how to discuss complexities during interviews  
- Links to useful resources  

We’ve also prepared a **Complexity Handout (PDF)** with common algorithms and their complexities.  
👉 [Download the Complexity Handout](./ComplexityHandout.pdf)  

⚠️ Note: Don’t just **memorize** these complexities. Instead:  
- Study why they are what they are  
- Practice deriving them yourself  

That’s how you’ll be able to explain them clearly in an interview.

## 📝 Example
We’ll continue with the **ZigZag problem** and show how to evaluate complexity for it in an interview.  

If you feel rusty, review the **Computational Complexity** section before tackling this example.

## ▶️ What’s Next?
In the next lesson, we’ll focus on the [**Code**](../Code/README.md) area of the Canvas.  
You’ll learn:  
- How to write code effectively during interviews  
- Rules and best practices  
- Common misconceptions to avoid  

Let’s move on to writing clean, interview-ready code!
