# ðŸ“˜ DSA in Golang

Welcome to the **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** repository!  
This repo contains solutions to common **DSA problems** implemented in **Go (Golang)**.  
The goal is to build a clean collection of practice problems with explanations and optimized code.

---

## ðŸš€ Why this repo?
- Practice **LeetCode-style problems** in Go.
- Learn **core DSA concepts** with clean implementations.
- Prepare for **coding interviews** with real-world patterns.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each problem is organized as a Go file under its respective folder:
