# 🧪 Testing Your Code

Once your code is written, you don’t just stop and say *“I’m done”*.  
A strong next step is to **verify it with tests**.  
Even better: explain to your interviewer how you would also **unit test** your code beyond the simple cases.

## 🔑 Why Testing Matters
Showing that you understand and care about testing is a **big advantage** in interviews. It demonstrates that:  
- You know the importance of testing in software development.  
- You won’t just write buggy code and ship it.  
- You’ll think about edge cases, write unit tests, and review your work.  

👉 Testing gives your interviewer confidence in your engineering mindset.

## 🧩 Sample Tests vs Extensive Tests
There are two kinds of testing at interviews:

### 1️⃣ Sample Tests
- Small examples you run **step by step** through your code.  
- Usually done right after finishing the code, or when asked by the interviewer.  
- “Small” does not mean trivial — it should still check correctness.  

### 2️⃣ Extensive Tests
- A broader set of test cases that you would design in real life.  
- Usually you don’t run them one by one — instead, you explain what tests you’d include.  
- This demonstrates **test design skills**.

## 🧪 Extensive Testing – What to Include
A **good test set** usually covers:

- **Edge cases**  
  - Min/max inputs  
  - Empty arrays/strings  
  - Negative numbers, duplicates, etc.  
- **No solution cases**  
  - To check your code handles impossible scenarios gracefully.  
- **Non-trivial functional tests**  
  - Cases that validate the internal logic of the algorithm.  
- **Randomized tests**  
  - To ensure it works in “average” situations (not just neat human-picked cases).  
- **Load testing**  
  - Stress your code with the largest inputs allowed by constraints.  
  - Helps verify performance and memory usage.  

A balanced test set = edge cases + functional + random + load.

## 🧪 Sample Testing – What to Use in Interviews
During an interview, you usually don’t have time for randomized or load tests.  
Instead, pick **small but meaningful cases**:  

1. A **non-trivial functional case**  
2. A couple of **edge cases**  
3. A **no solution** case  

👉 This combination gives the most confidence with the least time investment.

## 🏋️ How to Prepare
Here are three activities to boost your testing skills:

1. **Understand test categories**  
   Get familiar with edge, functional, random, and load tests.  

2. **Study sample test cases**  
   Most algorithm problems include example cases. Pay attention to which scenarios they cover. Then think about which important cases are missing.  

3. **Use the Canvas**  
   Always fill in the **Test Cases** section of the Algorithm Design Canvas. Write down scenarios you’d check.  

💡 Practicing this repeatedly will make you naturally consider tests for every problem.

## ✅ Why This Impresses Interviewers
Many candidates don’t test their code at all.  
Even fewer propose **unit tests** they would write in production.  

By:  
- Running a few sample tests, and  
- Suggesting some real-world unit tests…  

👉 You immediately stand out as a more **complete engineer**.
