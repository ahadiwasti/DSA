# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms – Introduction

Welcome to the first lesson of this **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** course! 🚀  

If you’re preparing for **tech interviews**, you’ll need strong skills in problem solving and a clear way to approach coding challenges. This course is designed to help you **build confidence** and **master the basics of DSA**.

## 🎯 Why This Course?

Tech interviews often involve:
- Solving **algorithmic problems** under time pressure  
- Applying the right **data structures** (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash maps, etc.)  
- Using **common algorithms** (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, graph traversal, etc.)  

If you feel uncertain about any of these, this course will guide you step by step.

## 📝 Algorithm Design Canvas

We’ll be using the **Algorithm Design Canvas** (not our invention, but a proven method) as a structured way to approach problems.  

It’s like a **framework or checklist** that helps you:
- Understand the problem clearly  
- Identify inputs, outputs, and constraints  
- Pick the right data structures  
- Design and optimize your solution  

This method is especially useful in interviews where you have limited time and need to stay focused.

## 🏋️ Practice Tasks

Learning DSA is all about **practice**.  
That’s why each section includes:
- Short **theory lessons** (to learn concepts)  
- **Sample problems with solutions** (to see the approach)  
- **Exercises for you** (to practice and build confidence)  

For real practice, we recommend using platforms like:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)  
- HackerRank  
- Codeforces  
- InterviewBit  

These sites provide thousands of categorized problems that you can solve directly in your browser.

## 🚀 Final Note

This course combines **theory, practice, and proven strategies** to help you succeed in your tech interviews.  

Stay consistent, practice often, and use the Algorithm Design Canvas to structure your thinking. Over time, you’ll not only improve your DSA skills but also feel more confident facing interviews.  

✨ Good luck — you’ve got this!
